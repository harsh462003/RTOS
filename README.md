# Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

A collection of C programming implementations exploring fundamental concepts in Real-Time Operating Systems.

## About

This repository contains practical implementations of core RTOS concepts including process management, scheduling algorithms, synchronization mechanisms, and real-time system programming.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C
- **Environment**: Linux/Unix
- **Tools**: GCC, POSIX system calls, FreeRTOS

## Key Topics

- Process scheduling and management
- Inter-process communication
- Synchronization and concurrency
- Deadlock handling
- Multithreading
- Real-time system implementation

## Getting Started

Compile and run programs using:
```bash
gcc -o program program.c -lpthread
./program
```
